# Mouzikka
Music Player Desktop App

Mouzikka is a Music Player desktop app made in Python programming language.
I have used all the core concepts of python to implement this, thus its a project to make a command over your core concepts of python, i.e. data structure of python, database connectivity, Object Oriented Concepts.
The database I have used here is 'Oracle', you may use any of your choice by making some changes in the module.py file's database connectivity section.
Some additional libraries I've worked with in this project are for the music player's functionality and its view, so as to make it more functionable and real with an easy-way implementation. These are
-pygame
-tkinter
-mutagen

Hope you'll enjoy developing it.
Thank you.
